treatise, according to his account of the matter, these

, exercises are recommended as a more certain remedy
for the gout than either black or white helleboro, or

even the cau mddicinal. But, besides thecure of the
Gout, it is also alleged, that Hippocrates recommends

, Goffing, Bowling, and Swimming, as infallible prophy· ·

lactics, both for blue devils and dull care. It cannot
therefore seem wonderful to the learned reader, that the
recommendation of these exercises should have claimed
the particular attention of faithful sons of AEsculapius.

- But as Apollo was the God of Song as well as of Physic,¹

the children of AEsculapius could not think of celebrat-
ing his games without music. An annual price, there·
fore, was instituted for the most laughable Macaronic

Poem‚ either in English, in Latin, or in a mixtureofboth, ’

which should be produced at the convention. This, like

the prizes at the Olympio Games, has called forth strenu- ’

ous competition, and given birth to many productione,
which are carefully preserved in the minutes of the Club.
Of thesea few are now printed in this collection.

· Besides original effusione, it was also thought to be ,

highly worthy of the celebrators of the Ludi Apollinares,
to preserve some ancient poema, particularly in the Ma÷
caronic style, which, notwithstanding their excellence,
were, to use a Boolneller's phrase, out of print. With
this view, in the year 1801, under their direction, a
fasciculus was published, containing some choice morsels,
particularly translations into morem Latin, of some
truly laughable Poems in the anciem scotist longauge,

alanguage now hardly understood even in the metro·¹
polis of Caledonia. ’
