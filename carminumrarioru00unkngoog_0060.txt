XVIII.
Syne ilka thing gued arse o’er head,
Chenlers, boord‚ stools, an' stoups,
Flew through the house wi’ muolde speed,
Au’ there was little hopes
But there hed been some ill-done deed,
Tbey gut sic thrawert cowps3
Ἴ But a' the ekaith that chano’d indeed,
Wes only on their dowps,
Wi’ fa’e that day.
XIX.
Sae whiles they toolied‚ whiles they drank,
’ Till a’ their sense was emoor'd3
An’ in their maws there was nae mank3
Upon the furms some snor‘d:
Ithers free off the bunkers sanlt,
Wi’ een like collops scor'd3
Some remm'd their noddles wi’ a clank,

E'en like a thick-scull’d lord‚
On posts chat day ⁴⁸.
