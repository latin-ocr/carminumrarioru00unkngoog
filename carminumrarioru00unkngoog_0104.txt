LXIV.
Whan supper's o'er‚ and thanks are gi’en,
Mirth duces mund wi’ canty mien,
In daffin', and in gabbin keen,
’ An hour they pass3

And ¹illua lad, wi’ pauky een,

Look's at his lass·

, Lx'v.

But Molpheus begins to chop, Ι
And bids them ε’ gae tak’ a nap;
And whan they've sleepit like α’ tap,

They rise to καὶ,
Like Phoebus out o’ Thetis' lap,

As blyth's a lark.

of the manners of Scotish pensants, into the languagehof
V'irgil's Georgica,¹ would afford an excellent 'subject for
the exertions of genius, by some young classica! scholar. Ἴ
