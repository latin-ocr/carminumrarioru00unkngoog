soNG IN PRA1sE or GowrrNo,

Composed sor thr Blaokkeath aab, in tlte neighbourhood
of Londoo, and osten sung with great spirit ot the ce·
lebration ‹ffthe Ludi Apollinares ffEdinburgh.

, Ι.
Or rural diversione, too long has the chace,
All the honours usurp'd, and assum’d the chief place3
But truth bids the Muse from henceforward proclaim,
’ Toat Gowf, first of sports, shall stand foremost in fame.

ΙΙ.
At Gows we oontend, without roncour or spleen‚ ,
And bloodless the laureis we reap on the green3
From vig'rous exertion four pleasures mise,
And to crown our delig'hts no poor fugitive diesss ·

IIL
O'er the heath see our heroes in uuiiorm elad,
In parties well match'd‚ how they gracefully spread3
While with long strokes and short strokes they tend to
the goal,
And with put well-directed plump into the hole.

IV.
From exercite strong, from strength active and bold,
We’ll traveise the green, and forget to grow old.
Blue devils, disemos, dull sorrow and-care,

Knock'd down by our balls as they whizz thro’ the air.
