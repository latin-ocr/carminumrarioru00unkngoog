The body of
Biennium anrxnnn Printer,
Like the cover of en old book,

Its contenis worn out,

And script of its lettering and gilding,
Lies here food ior the worms.

Yet the work shall not be lost,
For it shall, as he believed, appear once more,

In a new
And most beautiful edition,
corrected and revised ,
By the Author.

Ir the city of Boston, at the Public exprme, were to
erect a monument to the memory of Franldin, with the

above inscription, it would be honouroble both to them·
· selves ond their great Citizen.
