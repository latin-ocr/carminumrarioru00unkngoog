THE Monx ΛΝΒ

He saw (what ought not to be seen,
And scarce geve' cre'dit to his een)

. The parish priest, of reverend fame, .
In active conrtship with the dame·-
To lengthen ont description here,

ι Would but offend the modest ear,

And beet the lewder youthlu' fleme

That we by satire strive to teme. κ

Suppose the wicked action o'er,

And James continuing still to glowr ς .

, Wha saw the wile ns fest es able,

Spreed a clean service on the teble,
And syne free the ha’ ingle, bring beh
A pyping het young roasted hen,
And twa good bottles stout and clear,
Ane of stron'g ale, end nne of beer.
But, wicked lucli l just es the priest
” Shot in his fork in chucky’e bremt,
Th' unwelcome miller ga’e aroer,
., Cry’d, “ Bessy, haste ye ope lhe door.'’
With that the hely leteher fied,
And darn’d himself behind a bede
While Bessy huddled α’ things by,
That nought the cuckold might eepy ς
Syne loot him in,-but out olnae,
Speer'd why he lest the mill sae soon 3
“ 1 come,'' said he, “ as manners elaims,
To eracli end wait on Mr James,

Whilk 1 shou‘d do, tho' ne’er so bizzy ς

Ι sent him here, gudewife, where is he ?''
