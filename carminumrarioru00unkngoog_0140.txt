EPITAPH

ΟΝ

ROBERT BURNS, .

THE Annsnlnn BARD·

Toleen, mutato nomine, from the Elegy, written by Isim-
seff, en Captain Hendersou.

Ο Robbie Bonus, the man, the bn’ther,

And art thou gone-end gone for ever ς

Ι And hest thou eross’d that unknown river,

. Life's dreary bound.
Like thee, where shall we find wither,

The world oround.

Go to your sculptuffd tombs ye great,
In ε’ the tinsell trash of state3
But by thy honest turs I'll weit, ι
’ ‘ Thou men of worth,
And 'weep the sweetest Poet's fate,
E’er liv’d on earth.

...nu——

Burns demonstreted his veneration for deperted ge-
nius, by the tombstone which he placed in the Canongate
church·yard‚ ot the grave of Ferguson, the ingenious
author of some admirable Sootish Poemsz end, by his
own writings', he has erected to himselfo monument cere
perennius. Yet it is perhaps a disgrace to the present
ege, that no stone marks the turs where his morta! port
was deposited.
