22 chemin-mex eneae euenit:

vn,

Syne' Robinroy began¹ to revel, ’

And Dauny to him druggit: ι
- *⁶ Let he,'’ quo' Joclc, and ca’d him Jevei,
And by the tait him tuggit ς,

The kensie clikit till e keveI,
. Good Lord! ae they twa luggit:
They partit manly on e nevel, . '

Men say that hair was ruggit, . Δ
F ell sair that day.

VIII.

Ane bent a bow, sic siuet did· stee'r him,
. Nee mes was to have scarr'd him,
He cheis'd a flene as did effeir him
The t'ither cry’d Dirdum (lardum.-
Thro' baith the cheeks he thought to sheer him,
Or thro’ the arse have charr'd him,
By en aiker braid it cam na near him,
I wonder uait what marr'd him,
See wide thet day.

IX.'
A yap young man that stood him neist
Loos'd aff a bowt wi’ ire:

’ He ettl'd the barn in at the breast,

The howt flew o’er the hyre 3

“ Fy sirs,'' quo’ they, “ he’s elain a priest
A mile ayunt the mire θ’

Syne bow and bag frae him he kiest,

And fied es fierce as fire ,
’ mmmm
