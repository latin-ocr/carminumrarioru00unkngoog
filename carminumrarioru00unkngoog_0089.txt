IV.
They α’ drive to the ingle eheek3
Regardless of a fian o’ reek,

. And weil their meikle fingere beek,

Te gi’e them tune, ’
Syne sutore elson nimbly streek‚
To mend their shooe

V.
They pow and rex the lingel tails,
Into their brogs they ca' the neila,
Wi' hemmers now, instead o' flaile,

They mak' great rackets,

And set about their heels wi’ reils
0’ clinkin teckets.

VI.
And ey* till this mis-thriven ege, V
The gudemen here sat like e sege3
Wi’ mill in hand, end wiee'adegffi
He spent the night: 1
But now' he sits in chamber’s euge,
A pridefu' wight.

VII.
The lasses wi' their unshod' hee1s‚
Are sittin’ at their spinnin’-wheels‚

And we‘el ilk blythsome kemper deols,

The euld gudewife the pimey reels
Wi’ tenty hand. ·
