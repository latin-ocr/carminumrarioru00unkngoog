Aa the impression which was then printed has been
sold off, and as they are desimus of affording to the ris-
ing gencration some innocent amusement, they have given
directions for reprinting what they formerly published.
But, by going again to the presa, they aim also at a more
important object. Their last publication was the means
of bringing forth an admirable translation of an inimi·

y table Scotish Poem, Tae Wffe eff Aucbterrnuchty, which
will· be found in the present selection. They are not

without hopes, that this publication may lead to some ¹ 1

similar effirsions of genius, andis any Scholars ot the⁴
Rector's class in the High School, some of'whom have
of late given excellent proofs of poetic genius, shall

transmit to the scriba Pretorius, before the lat of Au· ·

gast next, a Macaronic or Latin Poem, in praise of the
Ludi Apollinares, an honorary medal, with a suitable
inscription, will be conferred, astho reward of Genius
and Industry, upon him whose poem is judged to be the
best.

The Theme proposed is, De Ludis Apollinaribus,
Carmen Semlare.

Edlnburglt, Janaary l, 1813.
