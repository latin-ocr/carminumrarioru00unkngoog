CHRYSTE-KIRK oie mew (ΜΝ. le

XVIII.

Neer bed-time novi, ilk weary wight
Was gaunting for his rest,

For some were like to tyne their sight,
Wi' sleep an’ drinking street.

But ithers that were stomech-tight.
Cry’d out, It was nae best

To leave e supper that was dight,

To brownies, or a ghaist,

To eat next day.
X1x; '
On whumelt tubs lay th lang dails', '
On them stuid mony agean, ·
Some fill’d wi' bruchen, some wi' keil, ,
'An' milk het free the loen.
0’ dalnties they had routh an’ wale,
¹ θ’ which they were right fon ς
But naething wad gae down but ele

Wi' drunken Donald Don,
The smith‚ that day.

Twa times aught bennecks in a heap, ' ,
An' twa guid junts 0’ bees,
’ Wi’ hind an' fore spaul o’ a sheep,
Drew whiltles'from ilk sheatht
Wi’ grevie e' their beards did dreep,
They kempit wi’ their teeth;
A kebbuck ayne thet meist could creep
Its lane, pat on the sheaf ’
In stous phet day.
