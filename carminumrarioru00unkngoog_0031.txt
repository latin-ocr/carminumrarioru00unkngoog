The huff. sae boisterously abeffi him,
Heto the earth dusht down: .
Γ The t’ither man for dead there lest him,
And fied out o' the town:

Ἴ The wives came furth, and up they rest him,

And saud life in the lown,
Wi' three routs'o' the arse they safit him, ’
And cur'd himout o' the synon, ’ ,-
Fou fast that day. μ

They gim’d, and let great girds wi' grains, ·
' Ilk gossip ither griev’d:
Some straek wi’ stings, some gathessd stanes Ἰ
Some fied and were reliev'd:
The minstrel crap within twa wainS,
That day he wisely priev’d,
For he wan hamc wi’ unbruis'd hanes,
Where fighters were mischiev'd
Ι Fell ill that day.

Heigh Hutchin wi' a hale-rice
To redd can thro’ them rumble,
He maw'd them down like maughtless mite..
He was nae baity humble:
Though he was wight he was nae wise
Wi' sicjanglers to jumhle,
For frae his thumb they daug e slice
Till he cry’d ‘⁶ Barlefumble, ι ¹ ..
l'm slain this day.”
