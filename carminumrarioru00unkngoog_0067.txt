THE MONK Ann

Out of the house some light did shine, '

Which led him till't as with o line:

Arriv’d, he knook'd, for doors were steekit3

Straight through a window Bessy keekit,

And eries, “ Wha’s that, gies folle a fright

At sic untimeous time o' night ?''

James, with good humour, maist disoreetly, '.

Tald her hid circumstance completely,

“ Ι dinna ken ye,'' quoth the wife,

.“ And up an down the thieves are rife3 ,

Within my lane, I’m but a woman,

Sne I’ll unbar my door to no man.

But since ’tis very like, my dow,

That a’ ye’ie telling may be true,

Hae, there'e a key, gang in your way

At the neist door, there's braw nit strae3

Streek down upon’t, my lad, ond leam

They're no ill lodg’d that get a barn?
Thus, after meikle clitter clatter,

¹ James fand he eondna mend the motter3

And since it mightna better be,
With resignation took the key,
Unlock't the barn-clam up the mou,
Where was an opening near the hon, ·
Through whilk he saw a glent of light,

That gave diversion to his sight:

By this he qnickly could di'soern

A‘thin wo' sep’rate house and born3
And through this rive was in the wo', ν
All done within the house he saw: - ·
