While I ducrive this happy spot,
The supper mannae be forgot‚

Now lasses round the ingle trot, .
To mak’ the brusa,-

And swankies they link aff the pot,
To hain their joes. ·

The dishes set on unspread table,
To answer nature’s wants are able,
'Round caps and platea, the ,cutties suble
Are flung ding daug:
The luds and lassas to enable
Their wames to pang-

Ἰ They ε’ thrang round the lang board now,
Whare there is meat for ilka mou'‚
Hiremen their hats and bonnets pu'
. Upo’ their face,
But gentle folks think shame to bow, '
Or say a grane. .

O here arejoys uninterrup’ -
Far hence is pleasure¹s gangreno cup3 ,
Olea-blooded health tends ilka sup
0 simple diet ς
But flees Μ’ stae lceeping’t up,
And midnight rint·
