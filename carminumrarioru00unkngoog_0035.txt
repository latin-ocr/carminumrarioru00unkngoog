XIX. ·
The millet was oi manly make,
To meet him was nee mowr:
Nae ten-some there duret him attede,
See knoyted he their pows. Ἴ
The bushment hail about him breite, -
And bicker'd him wi' bewe,
Syne treiterously behind his back
They hew’d him δ’ the hom, .
Ahint that day.

Twa that were headsmen of the herd,¹
On ither ran like rems,
'They follow’d seeming right unfeer'd
Beat on wi’ barrow treme:
But where their gabe they were ungeard,
They gat upo’ the garns,
Till bloody·barken’d was their heard
As they had worry'd iambe,
Maist like that day.
XXI.
The wives keist up a hideous yell‚
To see thee yonkers yokkit,
As fierce as flagi or fireflaught fell,
Frieks to the fields they flokkit:
The ceris wi' cluhe did other quell
On breests while blood out bokkit:
Ι See rudely rung the common bell Ι

Thata'thesteepleroekit, Α
For dread that day.
