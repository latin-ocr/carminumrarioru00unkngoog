Sic dencing and dewy,
Neither in Falklanrl 0' the green,

Το ὼηοε thee demosels them dight,
Thir lesses light of laits 3
Their gloves'were of the raffei right, ’. i
Their shoon were of the siraits,
Their gowns were of the Lincom light,

They were sae nice when men them nicht
They squeel'd like ony gaits,
Fou loud thet day.

Of α’ these maidens mild es meid,
Was nane sae jimp as Giuys
Like ony rose her rude was red,
Her lire was like the lily:
Fon sleik and yellow was her heed3

’ . But she of love was silly,
Tho' a' her kin had sworn her dead,

She wad hee but rweet Why,
Alane that ὼγ.
