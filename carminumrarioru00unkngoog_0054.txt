Now frae east nook o’ Fife the dawn
¹ Speel'd &estlines up the list,
Carles wha heard the cock had cram,
Begoud to tax an’ ristz
An' greedy wives wi' girning thrawn,
cry’d„ Lasses up to thrist3
Dogs barked‚ an' the lads frae hand· Ι ,
Bang'd to their breeks like drist,
Be break o’ day.

But some wha had been fou yestreen,
Sic as the letter-gae,
Air up had nae will to be seen,
Grudgin their groat to pay.
But what ast fn'sted’s no forgien,
Whan foul< has nought to say3
Yet sweer were they to rake their een,
Sic dizzy heads had they,
’ An’ het that day.
