XII,
The tailor lad, lang fam’d for fleas,
sits here and maks and mends the elaea ς
And vow the swankies like to teano
ἵ Him wi' their mocks,
The women cry, ⁴⁶ He’s ill to piense,”.
And crack their jokes.

XIII.
But he’s a sIee and cunnin’ loun,
And taunts agaIn ilk'jeerIn' clown3
For, tho' no bred in borrows town, -
. He's wond’rous gabby,
And south o’ wit comes frae his crown, · -
Tho’ he be shabby.

XIV. ·
Auld farrant tales he skreeds Μ’)
And ca’s their leat but dippings α’.
And bids them gang to ῚῚιίωόἰε-Ιιω,
¹ Wi' needle speed,
, And there leam wit without aflaw,
. Frae the haurd-head.

XV.
Auld luckie says they're in α creeI,
And redds them up, I trow‚ fu’ weel,

Cries‚ “ Lases, occupy your wheel, ’ ⁴
*ί And strait' the pin ;”'

And bids the tailor haste and dreel ,
Wi' little din.
