Syne the blyth carles,tooth an' nail,

An try wha was maist stark3

The scater, millet, with, and Dick,
Et cet'ra, closs sat cocldn, -
Till wasted was baith cash an' tick, ¹
Sae ill were they to slockent
Gane out to pish in gutters thick,
Some fell, and some gued rockid,
Sawney hang sneering on his stick, ·
To see bald Hutchon bockin

1 The smith’s wife her blank deary sought,
An' fand him skin and bIrn ς

Quoth she, “ This day's wark’s be dear bought ;’'

Mair, l'sq wind ye a pirn,
