Be that time it was fair four days,
As fou's the house cou'd paug,
To sep the young fok ere they raise,
Gossips came in ding dang,

Ilk ane their gists down flung:
Twall toop-horn spoons down Maggy lays,
Baith muckle-mou'd an' lang,
For kail or wbey.

ι An’ gabble like a goose‚
Shorin, whan fou, to skelp ye’r skin,

Lay them alang his pow or shin,
Wha wius syne may mak roose ,

Auld Bessy in her red cont braw,

Came wi’ her ain oe Nanny,

A moupin runkled granny:

Nor wad they let lucky Μ’,

Till she was sou wi' branny,

Like mony mae· · ’
