Who sees and hears thee full of fun,

’Twas this first made me love the dose

Which 'reis'd such pimples on my nose;
- For while 1 fill’d to ev'ry toust,

In wine all soher thoughts were lost·

Ι felt the claret and champaigne
Infleme my blood, and mad my brein3
My toast fell sault'ring from my tongue,
I'soaroely heard the catch I sung.

Ι found my gorge with sickneos rise3

The eendles danc'd before my eyes3
My sight grew dim 3 the room turn'd round3
Ι 1 tumbled senseless on the ground.
