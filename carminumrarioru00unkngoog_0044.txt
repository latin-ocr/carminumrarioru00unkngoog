A Claud Peky was nae very blate,
He stood nae lang a·dreigh;
For hy the warne he gripped Kate,
Ι An' ges'd her gi'e a ekreigh:
Haud eff, quoth she, ye filthy slate,
Ye stink o’ leeks, Ο feighl
Let gae my hands, I say, be qu'ait ς
An' wow gin she was skeigh
An’ mim that day.

Now settl’d gossies set, an' keen
Did for fresh bickers birle;
While the young swankies on the green
Took round a merry title:
Meg wellet, wi’ her pinky een,
Gart Lawrie's beart-stringe dirle3
¹ An' fouk wad threep, thet she did goeen
For what wad gar her skirle
An’ekreigh some day.

The manly millet, heffan’ haff,
Cam out to shaw guid will,
Flang by his mittans an' hie staff,
Cry'd, Gi’e me Paty’s Mil];

They roos’d him thet had skill;
