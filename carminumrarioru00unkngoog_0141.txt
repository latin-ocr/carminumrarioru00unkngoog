Besso as th’ immortal gods is he
The youth who fondly sits by thee,

And hears and sees thee ull the while
Softly speak ond oweetly smile.

’Twas this depriv’d my soul of rest,
And rois'd such tumults in my breost5
For while 1 gaz'd, in transport tost‚
My breath was gone, my voice was lost.

My bosom glow²d3 the subtle fleme
Rau quick thro' all my vital frame3
O'er my dim eyes o darkness hunffl

My blood with gentle horrore thrill'd3

My feeble pulso forgot to ployz
I fainted, sunk, end died away.
