CANTILENAE GYMNASTICAE·

From Yankies our best troops retreat, s
· And with a Congress parley.

¹‘I'hough by severity misled,
Both King and Court would have me dead ς
The blood 1 for my country shed,

Α Will yet be iny salvation:

1 die in hopes I’ll soon be where,
Great Wolfe enjoys the starry sphere ς
· And looking downwards, sheds a tear,
To see the alteration.

’ Petition to tte King.
γ Ι am a chief of the M‘Craws‚
Knew nothing of your Lowland lawe,
Which of my stealing was the cause,
But I’ll not steal again, Sir.

Ο let me eff this ae time,

This ae time, this ae time,

Ο let me aff this ae time, ’

l'll never steal again, sir. Δ

A fencible I'll μετὰ at home,

Or on the sees a sailor roam,

Even common soldier l'll become,
Or what else -you incline, Sir,

Olet meeff thisae time, διο. -
