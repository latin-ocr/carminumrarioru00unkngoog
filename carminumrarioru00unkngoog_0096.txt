Wi’ bIrr he bangs his paper out,
And thinks his pqint ayont a doubt,
To ilka him he tak's his tout,
(For he’s nae fae)
And gangs just staverIng about
In quest o' prey.

After he's rais'd a needless reek,
Syne he begins to gIow mair meek,
For he meets wi’ a great begeek
. Frae empty biuks,
Sae wi' his finger in his cheek,
Awa’ he slinks.

The gaugesss scarcely Irae the door,
Wha'n beggnrs they come in gelon,
Wi’ wallops flapping In great stom,
Rais’d up iu cairus,
And birns baith a·hint and ’fore

” Ο’ greetin'bairns.

XXXV.
The auld anes raise a whinging tone,

'And sigh and zob, and cry, Ohon!
Syne blessIngs come wi’ mony drone,
Frae man and wife,
wha to their childer seek a scone,
To succour life.
