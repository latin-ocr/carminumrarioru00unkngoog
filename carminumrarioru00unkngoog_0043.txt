Tam Taylor, wha' in time o' battle
Lay as gin some had fell’d him,
Gat up now wi' an unco’ rattle,
As nane there durst a‚quell'd him: ,
Bauld Bess flew till him wi' abrattle, ,
An’ spite o' his teeth held him
close by the craig, ιη’ wi' her fatal
Knife shored she wad geld him,

Syne α’ wi' ae consent shook hands,
As they stuid in a rihg3
Some redd their hair, some set their banda,
Some did their sark-tasss wring;
Then for a'hap to shaw their brands,
They did their minstrel bring,
Whare elever houghs h'ke willie-wands, Α

At ilka blythsome spring,
“ Lap high that day.
