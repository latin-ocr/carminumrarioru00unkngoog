Abour six months ego, a small publication appeared at
Effinburgh, entitled, Curminum Rariorum Macaronico-
- rum Delectat, in Usum Ludomm Apollinarium. Fusci·
culm secundun. Thet celebrated, though now very
source Poem‚ the Wife ol Auchtermuchty, was one of
the articles which this'faseculus contained. The Editor,
in a'note at the beginning of it, made the following ob·
serrsuon.

‘⁴ lt is much to be feared thet the beauties ol this ex· ·
callent poem will be lost to modern readers, as the an·
cient Scotiab dialect- in which itis written is now'not
without difficulty understood even by the untiqrmrian.
By an elegant translation into the Latin langusge, the
' munies ol this poem would be preserved to latest poste·
rity. It is therefore much to be wished, that some cles·
sicar scholar would (ιο ne ame honour a ets as ra
lately been done to some other Scotish poems.’'

A few'weeka after this notice appeared, the Latin
nsnslution, now presented to the public, was sent to the ,
Scriba Praetorius for the celebration of the Ludi Apolli·

neres, inclosed in the following Latin letter.¹
