Is nothing but· the want of benith,
And that indeed isia disaster,

When ’tis occasioned by aplester

AEgri utuntur conspiciliis.

To this, and ten times more, his skiss
Extende when he could cure or kill.

And ertiully contrives romencesi

How well he arches, and shoots flying,
(Let no man think thot we nnean lying,)
